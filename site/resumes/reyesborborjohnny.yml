    summary: |
      I'm passionate about problem-solving and analytical thinking. Alongside my degree, I’ve gained experience tutoring 
      high school students in mathematics and physics, which has strengthened my communication and teaching skills. 
      My academic journey has included a focus on number theory—currently working on a thesis about elliptic curves.
      I’m eager to keep growing professionally in roles where I can contribute both technical precision and creative insight.
