    summary: |
      I am extremely excited to bring 23 years of sales, marketing, business development and audiovisual production experience with me into my new career as a Full Stack Software Engineer! When I was young, one had to attend a top technical university in order to become a software engineer, and since I was discouraged from attending MIT to attend Louisiana State Univerity for a track scholarship, I have been dreaming of what life would be like to be an actual software engineer. Now that I have the opportunity to fullfil that dream, and I will utilize the drive of an athlete, the strategy of a coach, the networking abilities of a business development executive, and the swagger of a salesperson to be an impactful presence on any team I have the privilege of being a part of. So, put me in coach! I'm ready to build our dreams in code!
