  summary: >
    I’ve spent the last six years of my life dedicating all my time and
    effort to my 

    professional goals, studying and working at the same time with the aim of becoming 

    a great developer and making a living from it. 

    Right now, I’m looking to gain professional experience to grow 

    both as a developer and as a person. That’s why I’m currently studying full-stack 

    development—to gain new knowledge that will help me achieve my goals.
