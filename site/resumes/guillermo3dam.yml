    summary: |
      I originally trained and worked as an electrician, but over time I realized I wanted to pursue a more creative and intellectually stimulating career.
      This led me to study a Higher National Degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM), where I discovered my true passion for programming.

      Since then, I have continued to strengthen my skills in software development while working in logistics, and I am now actively preparing myself for my first professional opportunity as a programmer.
      I am eager to keep learning and growing in this field, contributing with dedication and a hands-on mindset.
