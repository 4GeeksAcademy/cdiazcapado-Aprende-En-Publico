    summary: |
      I am a Web Development student at Full Sail University and an AI Automation student at Andrew Tate's The Real World program. 
      My focus is on creating extremely user-friendly, straightforward, and modern web applications. 
      I specialize in using tools like Visual Studio Code, Bolt.new/Lovable.dev, Supabase, Firebase, Voiceflow, and other no/low-code platforms to build 
      functional solutions that solve real-world problems.

      I want to build platforms that combine AI automation with simple design for marketers and entrepreneurs.
