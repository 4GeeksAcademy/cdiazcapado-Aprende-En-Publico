    summary: |
      I built my career in the tourism industry, where I combined customer service, organization, and cross-cultural communication. I worked in fast-paced environments, assisting people from around the world and handling real-time situations. This experience strengthened my social skills, ability to work under pressure, and passion for creating memorable experiences. I learned to anticipate needs, adapt quickly, and act with empathy. Tourism taught me to see the world with an open mind and a proactive attitude.
