    summary: |
      Geographer with experience in spatial analysis, cartography, remote sensing,
      natural resource management, territorial planning, and GIS application development.
      I have worked as a GIS analyst in national research institutes performing spatial
      modeling, photointerpretation, land classification, and designing cartographic
      products for urban and rural studies.

      In recent years I have also developed solid skills in web development, including
      full-stack applications using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and front-end
      technologies. I am currently strengthening my programming skills in Python and SQL,
      focusing on GIS automation, geospatial development, and clean architecture.
