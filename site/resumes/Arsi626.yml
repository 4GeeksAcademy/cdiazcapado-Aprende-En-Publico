      details: |
        In Sistemas Microinformaticos y Redes,I learned how to install, configure, and maintain computers, operating systems, and local networks.
        I worked on assembling and repairing equipment, managing users and permissions, and setting up basic servers.
        I also practiced troubleshooting, providing technical support, and applying essential cybersecurity measures.
        it was a hands-on program focused on practical IT administration and support.

        my job would be to prepare and randomize the cards before they return to the game.
         I would collect all the used cards, mix them thoroughly, and create a fresh shoe with a completely unpredictable order.
          I’d make sure the shuffle is fair, secure, and impossible to influence. Once the new deck is ready, 
          I’d return it to the table smoothly so the game can continue without interruptions.
         In short, I’d be responsible for ensuring fairness, randomness, and a clean reset every time the shoe is changed.
